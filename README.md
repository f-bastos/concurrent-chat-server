# Multiclient Chat Server

This project was developed during my 7th week at Code for Allâ€™s Full Stack Programming Bootcamp. It is a simple representation of a Concurrent Chat Server.  
The project was created to run in the Terminal.


Developing new features:
- insert username
- send a message only to a specific user
